As you can see, I've added a new journal page to the site!
<br>
I just wanted to make the home page a little cleaner, and since i removed the 'to top' link at the bottom, i figured i'd make a page where it actually makes sense to use it
<br>
anyways, i've been demolishing school, java is going well (with a little help from <a href="https://alex-langel.github.io/index.html"> my friend </a>)
<br>
if anyone has more ideas for the site, go ahead and leave a comment in <a href="http://users.smartgb.com/g/g.php?a=s&i=g19-02009-ae"> the Travelers Log </a> 
<br>
otherwise, i hope everyone's year is going well. i had a goal to be super productive this year and i think i'm on track (not as much as i could be but balance is a virtue)
<br>
Jack out!

Updated the graphics of the site a little bit, just spicing it up with my own photos and flair
<br>
Also added links to the footer and to the badges on the home page, click em to see where they take you!
<br>
I tried adding autoplaying music to the site but it wouldn't let me upload mp3's, so i might see if i can get it working with a hidden youtube embed
<br>
but thats a task for later
<br>
In other news, i submitted my project in javascript and it's worth 100 points, so hopefully i get a good grade or else im kinda screwed LOL
<br>
yeah, 'nother small update but the site is coming along!
<br>
Thats all though, Jack out!

So since i'm going to school for software engineering, I figured that I'd revamp/ work on this site a lil bit
<br>
So far, I've gotten the home page and artwork page up and running, now to find out how to implement music ðŸ¤”
<br>
Probably should find something better than the scroll box for the artwork, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
<br> 
That's all for now, Jack out!
